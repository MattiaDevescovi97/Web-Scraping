# Web-Scraping

These are a series of web scrapers that I built to mine different data of interest. Websites with the corresponding data mined are:

- https://www.vivino.com/IT/en/ --> It is a wine e-commerce where I mined data relative to: product name, grape type, rating, number of ratings, product type (red, white, sparkling and rose), country of origin, price, wine characteristics (acidity, bold, tannic and sweetness) and food pairing.
- https://it.everli.com/it --> It is a grocery e-commerce where I mined data relative to: product name, description, 2 levels of categorization, and product id
- https://www.farmae.it/ --> It is a pharmaceutical e-commerce where I mined data relative to: MINSAN (Italian general code that identifies the product), product name, product description, product categorization and image
